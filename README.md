# Digit_recognizer_using_keras
Basic code for Digit Recognizer using keras on Google colab.

With this model, my goal was to correctly identify digits from a dataset thousands of handwritten images. <br/>
For this, I have used famous MNIST("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset from Kaggle.
