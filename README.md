# Digit_recognizer_using_keras

With this model, my goal was to correctly identify digits from a dataset thousands of handwritten images. <br/>
I have used famous MNIST("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset from Kaggle.

This is the basic code for Digit Recognizer using Keras and Tensorflow on Google Colaboratoty.
